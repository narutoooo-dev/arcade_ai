# Arcade AI

> Universal multi-provider LLM chat client for Android, Windows and Linux — dark, fluid, secure.

🇷🇺 [Версия на русском](README.ru.md)

Arcade AI is a single mobile app that talks to **any** large language model. Drop
in an API key, pick a provider, choose a model — and chat. From global giants
(OpenAI, Anthropic, Google) to Russian platforms (YandexGPT, GigaChat) to your
own endpoint (Polza AI, a proxy, or a local Ollama server).

## Features

- **12 built-in providers** + a fully custom one (any OpenAI- or Anthropic-compatible endpoint).
- **Streaming responses** — text appears token by token, like the web chats.
- **Reasoning view** — for thinking models (o-series, DeepSeek R1, Claude with
  extended thinking) a collapsible panel shows *how* the model reasoned before answering.
- **Vision** — attach photos to your message where the model supports it.
- **Browser (beta)** — paste a link into your message and the app downloads
  the page itself, strips the HTML and hands the clean text to the model.
  Even a tiny local model (1B on Ollama) can "read the web". Toggle it in
  settings; the per-page text limit is adjustable (8000 chars by default),
  and the chat shows only a compact "🌐 site · size" chip.
- **Compare two models** — long-press Send to ask two models the same prompt
  side by side, then keep the better answer and continue with it.
- **Bilingual UI** — English / Russian, picked on the welcome screen, switchable later.
- **Security first** — API keys live in the hardware-backed **Android Keystore**
  (AES-GCM); optional **biometric auto-lock** on reopen.
- **Crafted design** — pure-black surfaces, restrained violet accents, an animated
  aurora background, and motion on every meaningful transition.

## Supported providers

| Global | Russian / Regional | Local & custom |
|---|---|---|
| OpenAI, Anthropic, Google Gemini, Groq, DeepSeek, xAI Grok, Mistral, Together AI, OpenRouter, Cohere | GigaChat (Sber) | Ollama, any custom endpoint |

> **GigaChat** uses Sber's OAuth: paste your Authorization key (Base64) and the
> app fetches and refreshes the short-lived access token for you. Sber's Russian
> root CA is trusted for `*.sberbank.ru` so requests don't fail on TLS.

> **Local models (Ollama)** connect to a *running Ollama server* over HTTP
> (`localhost:11434`) — the app does **not** load `.gguf` files directly. True
> on-device GGUF inference (pick a file, run it on the phone via llama.cpp) is on
> the roadmap, not in this build.

## Why these languages?

This started as a "mix the languages to look cool" idea. The honest engineering
answer shaped the final stack:

- **Dart + Flutter — the whole app.** Flutter is Dart's killer capability: one
  codebase compiled to native ARM, a self-rendered UI (Skia/Impeller) that looks
  pixel-identical on every device, and sub-second hot reload. For a polished,
  heavily-animated single-screen-flow app, nothing else gets you there faster.

- **No Rust (yet) — and that's the secure choice.** The instinct was to add Rust
  for "security via custom encryption." But hand-rolled crypto is a liability;
  the **Android Keystore** stores keys in a hardware security module where the
  secret never leaves the chip — strictly stronger than app-level AES. The app is
  network-bound (it waits on API calls), so there is no CPU hotspot for Rust to
  accelerate. Rust earns its place the day we add **on-device local inference** —
  that's a real compute task, and it's the planned hook for it.

The principle: every language must pull its weight, not pad a buzzword list.

## Remote SSH terminal + OpenCode (experimental)

> **Working.** The setup writes OpenCode's config file
> (`~/.config/opencode/opencode.jsonc`) with your provider, base URL, key and
> model, so OpenCode runs on **your** model instead of falling back to the free
> built-ins. Still young — treat the terminal as an early feature — but the core
> "your provider in OpenCode" flow works.

A separate **Terminal (BETA)** screen (open it from the chat drawer) turns the
app into a thin client for an agentic coding session running on **your own
machine** — no servers on our side. The idea: bring your own compute (a VPS, a
home PC, a Raspberry Pi) over SSH and run [OpenCode](https://github.com/sst/opencode)
from your phone.

**Flow:**
1. Pick **your data** (the app's active provider + key + base URL + model) or
   **Free** (OpenCode's built-in free models, no key).
2. Enter the machine: host / user / port / password (saved encrypted in the
   Keystore, optional).
3. Choose a **run mode** — *with confirmation* or *auto (no confirmation)*.
4. A clean step-by-step setup runs in the background (connect → detect package
   manager → install Node/git → install OpenCode → launch). The raw install
   output is hidden; on failure there's a collapsible log + retry.
5. OpenCode's TUI is rendered in a real terminal emulator (`xterm`) over the SSH
   shell, with quick keys (Esc/Tab/Ctrl-C, Ctrl+letter, arrows), paste, and a
   "manual terminal" mode for power users.

Built on `dartssh2` (SSH client) + `xterm` (terminal emulator) — the SSH protocol
and the emulator are libraries; the app is the glue + provisioning + UI.

**Known rough edges:**
- Your provider/key/URL/model are written into OpenCode's config file, so it
  uses your model. Pick **My data** for that, or **Free** for OpenCode's
  built-in models.
- The *auto/bypass* mode uses a best-effort env var; the exact flag may vary by
  OpenCode version.
- Reachability: same LAN works; a machine behind NAT needs Tailscale / a public
  IP / port forwarding.
- Installing packages needs root or passwordless sudo; otherwise the install
  prompts for a sudo password in the terminal.

## Build

```bash
flutter pub get

# Android (requires the Android SDK; minimum Android 6.0 / API 23)
flutter build apk --release
# output: build/app/outputs/flutter-apk/app-release.apk

# Windows (run on a Windows machine with Visual Studio)
flutter build windows --release

# Linux
flutter build linux --release
```

Requires Flutter (stable). **Windows users don't need to build anything** —
every release ships `ArcadeAI-Setup-x.y.z.exe`, a regular installer (Program
Files, Start menu shortcut, uninstaller) built automatically by GitHub Actions
(`.github/workflows/windows.yml` + `windows/installer.iss`).

## Security model

| Concern | Approach |
|---|---|
| API keys at rest | Android Keystore via `flutter_secure_storage` (AES-GCM, hardware-backed) |
| App reopen | Optional biometric / device-credential lock (`local_auth`) |
| Network | HTTPS to providers; cleartext allowed only for `localhost` (Ollama) |
| Telemetry | None — the app talks only to the provider you configure |
